# Deploy Docker Skill

This fallback skill keeps Deploy Docker work aligned with the conventions already present in this repository. Prefer extending the closest existing implementation over inventing a new abstraction, and verify neighboring states before finishing.

## Before You Code (REQUIRED)

This skill's content was captured at generation time and MAY be stale. For ANY non-trivial change involving deploy-docker, verify against current docs FIRST:



Then:

1. **Match the installed version.** Cross-reference against the version installed in this repo. APIs change across minor versions; do not assume.
2. **Discover provider best practices.** If the task touches a production-sensitive capability, inspect the provider service catalog, official docs, and project docs before choosing an implementation.
3. **Respect explicit direction.** If the user explicitly asks for a specific mechanism, follow it. If project docs clearly mandate a mechanism, follow the project. In both cases, mention the provider-recommended alternative and make the chosen path safe.
4. **Prefer provider-native primitives by default.** If no explicit user/project override exists and the change involves caching, rate limiting, background work, scheduled jobs, shared state, queues, or secrets, use the provider-recommended binding/API. Do not hand-roll an in-memory or polyfill solution that "works" locally but breaks under the provider's execution model — derive the need→native-primitive mapping yourself from this provider's docs.

## Capability Contract

Use this section when the user prompt touches production risk, even if the prompt does not name this technology explicitly.




Required wiring surfaces:
- runtime/infrastructure config: Dockerfile
- nearest typed request/context boundary
- handler/procedure boundary before external side effects

Side-effect barrier:
- Place guards before external APIs, auth mutations, email sends, analytics events, storage writes, and database mutations.


Fallback policy:
- Prefer provider-native/platform-managed primitives by default when no explicit override exists.
- Follow clear user/project overrides, but mention the native alternative and tradeoff.
- Fallbacks must be durable, multi-instance safe, and atomic under concurrency.

Verification rules:
- [error] native-or-explicit-override: Use the provider-native primitive first unless the user/project explicitly overrides it.
- [error] atomic-fallback: Fallback counters must be atomic under concurrency.

## Quick Start

### Inspect the current implementation

```sh
rg -n "deploy-docker|docker|ci-cd|deployment" .
rg --files | rg "deploy-docker|docker|ci-cd"
```

### Make the smallest compatible change

- Change the narrowest config surface that solves the problem cleanly.
- Keep environment assumptions, secrets, and deployment behavior explicit.
- Preserve the repository's existing workflow naming, build, and release conventions.

### Verify before finishing

- Validate the change against build, deploy, and rollback expectations.
- Check environment-specific assumptions before merging shared config edits.
- Confirm monitoring or operational visibility is still adequate after the change.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Why it matters | What to check |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Existing patterns | Keeps the repo coherent | Start from the nearest matching implementation before editing |
| Scope control | Prevents abstraction creep | Keep the change in the same layer as surrounding code |
| Verification | Catches regressions early | Recheck adjacent states, edge cases, and integration points |
| References | Speeds up repeat work | Use the linked topic files when the task needs deeper guidance |

## Common Patterns

### Docker

**When:** The task touches docker in Deploy Docker work.

- Inspect the nearest existing implementation before introducing a new pattern.
- Reuse naming, file placement, and helper utilities that are already established in this repo.
- Keep the change easy to review and easy to extend without widening scope unnecessarily.

### CI CD

**When:** The task touches ci cd in Deploy Docker work.

- Inspect the nearest existing implementation before introducing a new pattern.
- Reuse naming, file placement, and helper utilities that are already established in this repo.
- Keep the change easy to review and easy to extend without widening scope unnecessarily.

### Deployment

**When:** The task touches deployment in Deploy Docker work.

- Inspect the nearest existing implementation before introducing a new pattern.
- Reuse naming, file placement, and helper utilities that are already established in this repo.
- Keep the change easy to review and easy to extend without widening scope unnecessarily.
